1.🔹 What is a Closure? (Simple Definition)
👉 A closure is created when a function remembers variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.
2.🔹 What Exactly is Stored in a Closure?
A closure stores:
1️⃣ The function itself
2️⃣ Variables from its lexical environment
It does NOT copy values — it references them.
3.🔹 Closures in Real Life (VERY IMPORTANT)
1️⃣ Data Hiding (PRIVATE VARIABLES)
🔹 Closures in setTimeout (COMMON INTERVIEW TRAP
4.setTimeout runs later. When var is used, all callbacks share the same variable due to closure, so the final value is printed. Using let or a separate closure fixes this.
5.var → one shared variable ❌
let → separate variable each time ✅
6.👉 Promises and async/await run code LATER
Anything that runs later needs to remember data from earlier
That remembering = closure.
7.Promises and async/await use closures to remember variables needed after asynchronous operations complete.

1.Event Loop moves a callback ONLY when the Call Stack is empty.
2.🔹 Normal functions
✔ Run immediately
✔ Order = call order
🔹 Callbacks (timeout, click, fetch)
✔ Run later
✔ Order = when JS is free
3. Why Do We Need Callbacks?
JavaScript is:
Single-threaded
Event-based
Often asynchronous
So callbacks help when:
We don’t know when something will finish
We want code to run after another task
Examples:
Button click
Timer finished
Data fetched from server
4.You can’t return a click because the click happens asynchronously after the function has already finished executin
5.JavaScript Promises:A JavaScript Promise is an object representing the eventual outcome of an asynchronous operation. It acts as a placeholder for a value that is not available yet, allowing you to handle asynchronous code (like fetching data from an API) in a more readable and organized way than traditional callbacks.

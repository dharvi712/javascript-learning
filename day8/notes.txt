An object stores related data together using key : value pairs.
👉 Think of an object as a real-life entity.
Real-life example 👇
A student has:
name
age
branch
CGPA
All belong to one student, so we keep them inside one object.
2.🔹 Accessing Object Values
1️⃣ Dot notation (most common)
2️⃣ Bracket notation (important)
📌 Use brackets when:
key has space
key is stored in a variable
📌 this refers to current object.
3.There is no console.log without new line like C/C++ printf.
Every console.log() → new line.
So we combine values into one string, then print once.
4.🔹 What is an Array of Objects?
It’s exactly what it sounds like:
👉 multiple objects stored inside an array
5.👉 Use for loop when:
You need index
You need to modify array positions
You need reverse or skip logic
👉 Use for...of when:
You just want to read values
Working with arrays of objects
Writing clean, modern JS
6.🔍 What does map() do?
👉 Transforms each element
👉 Returns a new array
👉 Length of new array = length of original array
7.🧠 When to use map()?
✔️ Extract properties
✔️ Modify values
✔️ Create new arrays
❌ Not for filtering
8.✅ WAY 1: Implicit return (NO return keyword)
When you use ({ }), JavaScript automatically returns the object.
✅ WAY 2: Explicit return (WITH return keyword)
If you want to use return, you must use curly braces {}, not ({}).
👉 Because {} is confused with a function body.
👉 ({}) tells JS: this is an object, not a block.

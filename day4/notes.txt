1.Scope decides where a variable or function can be accessed.
2.Types of Scope in JavaScript:
1️⃣ Global Scope
2️⃣ Function Scope (Local Scope)
3️⃣ Block Scope (let, const)
4️⃣ Lexical Scope (foundation of closures)
3.✔ Accessible everywhere
❌ Dangerous (can be overwritten)
4.Bugs become hard to track
5.2️⃣ Function Scope (MOST IMPORTANT)
Variables declared inside a function are local to that function.
6.Each function creates its own scope
7.3️⃣ Block Scope (let and const)
Block = { }
8.var DOES NOT follow block scope
9.4️⃣ Lexical Scope (IMPORTANT FOR CLOSURES)
👉 Inner functions can access outer function variables.
